### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Leon and I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Informatics at the Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (UFPR). I previously graduated in Computer Science at UFPR. My field of research is computer networks and fault-tolerant routing algorithms.  
I currently work at the ParanÃ¡ State Court of Auditors (TCE-PR) as an intern. I work with projects in AI.  
I have worked on both front-end and back-end development projects as well as AI and AR research projects.  
I'm now looking forward to new opportunities to learn and new projects to work on.
